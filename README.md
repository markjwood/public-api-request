# Public API Request Project

This project was done for Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree - Unit 5. The purpose is to demonstrate an understanding of using public APIs, making API requests, and handling data asynchronously.

The app begins by getting twelve 'employees' from randomuser.me, then creates a gallery of cards, displaying each user's basic information. Clicking on an individual employee brings up a modal window with more detailed information.

The modal is closed when we either click outside of it, or click the 'x' in the top right corner of the modal.

## Toggling through employees

Within the modal, we can toggle through each employee's details with the buttons displayed at the bottom of the modal. If the employee displayed in the modal is the first or last in the gallery, the 'PREV' or 'NEXT' button is disabled, respectively.

## Search function

We can search for a specific employee using the search bar at the top right of the screen. The gallery updates in real-time as a search string is typed, or when the search button is clicked.
